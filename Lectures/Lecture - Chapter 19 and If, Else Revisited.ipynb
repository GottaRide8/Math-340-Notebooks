    "So why use one versus the other?  The point is that in the `if`, `elif`, `else` construction, the program stops once a condition is met.  In the other, all `if` case, every case is checked one after the other.  So `num_comp_alt` is not as efficient.  But it's not just about efficiency.  By keeping the `if`, `elif`, `else` sequence, we are also letting ourselves and others know that we are checking through a list of alternatives, i.e. only one of the three things can be true.  By separating over separate `if` statements, we are saying any or all of these things could be true simultaneously, and that is just not so.  Thus, using the essay analogy, it is poor writing to have only `if`'s.  \n",

Because of this, we say that the operation count of an Insertion Sort is $\\mathcal{O}(n^{2})$.  We can just as well think about taking say a list of numbers and arranging them in increasing order i.e. if I give you `[5,7,3]`, you should return `[3,5,7]`.  If you had `[3,7,5,3]`, you should return `[3,3,5,7]`.  So let's write that function.  I give you a list of integers.  You return a new, sorted list different than the first.  \n",
