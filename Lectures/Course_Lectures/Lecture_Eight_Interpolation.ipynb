    "# Interpolation\n",
    "\n",
    "So at this point, we now want to look at the following problem.  Suppose I give you some data in the form of a set of points\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left\\{x_{j},f_{j} \\right\\}_{j=0}^{n}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we think that $f_{j} = f(x_{j})$, which is to say, we think the data comes from a function $f(x)$, but we do not know the function $f(x)$.  The question becomes, how might we find an approximation to $f(x)$?  As it turns out, there are an infinite number of ways to solve this problem, each with good and bad features.  The approach we will study first is called _ Lagrange Interpolation _.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This method starts by deciding we are going to fit the data with an $n^{th}$ order polynomial, i.e. we choose a polynomial $P_{n}(x)$ of the form \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P_{n}(x) = p_{0} + p_{1}x + \\cdots + p_{n}x^{n},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the coefficients $p_{j}$ are found from the _ interpolation formulas _\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P_{n}(x_{j}) = f_{j}, ~ j=0,\\cdots,n.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, we have $n+1$ unknown coefficients $p_{j}$ and we have $n+1$ equations provided by the interpolation formulas.  Thus, we see that in principle we should be able to determine $P_{n}(x)$.  The advantage of having $P_{n}(x)$ is that anything else we want to know about $f(x)$, such as $f'(x)$ or $\\int f(x)dx$, we can find by using $P_{n}(x)$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, there is another important way to think about $P_{n}(x)$.  While it is _ completely equivalent _ to what we have described above, it forms a very fundamental way to think about interpolation that comes up again and again in applied mathematics and numerical analysis.  In this approach, we write $P_{n}(x)$ as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P_{n}(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{n} f_{j}L_{j}^{(n)}(x),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the functions $L_{j}^{(n)}(x)$ are themselves $n^{th}$-order polynomials which are defined so that \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L_{j}^{(n)}(x_{j}) = 1, ~ L_{j}^{(n)}(x_{k}) = 0, ~k\\neq j. \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see this idea illustrated in the figure below.  Here, we are interpolating through the data set\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{r|r}\n",
    "x_{j} & f_{j}\\\\\n",
    "\\hline\n",
    "-9 & 5\\\\\n",
    "-4 & 2\\\\\n",
    "-1 & -2\\\\\n",
    "7 & 9\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "![linterp](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Lagrange_polynomial.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "So as we see, we can build $P_{n}(x)$ from the weighted $L^{(n)}_{j}(x)$ functions, which act as a _ basis _ for our interpolating polynomial.  The question then is, how can we determine the functions $L^{(n)}_{j}(x)$.  "
