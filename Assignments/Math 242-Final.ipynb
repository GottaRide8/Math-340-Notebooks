    "<strong> Problem 6 </strong>: 6 pts.  *Shell sorting* is a list sorting algorithm that works in the following way.  First, for a list of size $n$, choose a gap size, say $\\delta$ to initially be $\\delta = n/2$ (round down if $n$ is odd), and then do an insertion sort using this gap size (see Midterm II for an explanation of doing insertion sorts with gaps).  Then reduce the gap size, say to $\\delta = n/4$, and so on and so forth until the gap size is identically one, i.e. $\\delta = 1$.  At that point, you are just doing a standard insertion sort, but so long as you implement the insertion sort properly, this should finish in far fewer operations than if you had started this whole process with a standard insertion sort.  \n",
