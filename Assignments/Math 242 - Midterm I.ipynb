By fortunate coincidence, the deviation between this lunisolar calendar and the true solar year is small enough to require a correction only once every 200 years. Thus the days are synchronized with the moon phase every month.\n",

    "Thus, on the planet Gethen, leap years of 365 days only occur every 200 years, and for a year to be leap year, it must be divisible by 200.  Assume the fourth month of the year is the month with 27 days in a leap year.  Otherwise, when it is not a leap year, each year has 14 months, and each month has 26 days.  Using a \"month/day/year\" format for inputting dates, build a series of functions which ultimately computes the number of days between any two dates.  "
